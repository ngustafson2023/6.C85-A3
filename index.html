			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p>
				Initial Question: How did the population of age groups change from 1900 to 2000?
			</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="bar.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Children: 0-14 years old, Youth: 14-24 years old, Adults: 25-64 years old, Seniors: 65+ years old
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The motivation behind a stacked bar chart was to facilitate a direct and immediate comparison between the two years. By stacking the age groups, the chart would quickly show the differences in age distribution.</li>
				<li>Different colors for each age group were chosen to create a clear visual distinction, allowing viewers to quickly identify and compare specific age groups.</li>
				<li>The legend was included because some individual sections of the bars were not large enough to fit an age-group label, and it would have been repetitive to include the same labels twice.</li>
				<li>What works well is the simplicity of comparison for the two different years. What doesn't work as effectively is showing the trend over the years between the two points, which I aim to address in the next sketch.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="area.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Children: 0-14 years old, Youth: 14-24 years old, Adults: 25-64 years old, Seniors: 65+ years old
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The area chart was chosen to illustrate the continuous evolution of the population's age profile over the entire century.</li>
				<li>Stacked areas were used to represent the growth or decline of each demographic segment, showing how each age group's population has changed over time.</li>
				<li>The age-group labels could easily be included in the stacked areas, which is a nicer design than including a legend, especially since only one label was needed per age-group.</li>
				<li>The reported population is significantly higher in 2000 than 1900. Therefore, while this effectively demonstrates the change in population of each age group, it doesn't effectively show the relative change in proportion amongst the age groups, which I aim to address in the next sketch.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="pie.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Children: 0-14 years old, Youth: 14-24 years old, Adults: 25-64 years old, Seniors: 65+ years old
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The pie chart was chosen to emphasize the part-to-whole relationship within each year.</li>
				<li>Labeling each segment with percentages was intended to facilitate understanding of the exact proportion of each age group.</li>
				<li>Similar to the last sketch, it was possible to include one label per age-group in the visualization, so no legend was necessary.</li>
				<li>The strength of this approach is in showing the composition of the population. However, like the first visualization, it is not effective at showing the trend between the two years.</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        I sought to sketch visualizations to answer the question, how did the population of age groups change from 1900 to 2000? First, I had to define "age groups", which I defined to be 0-14 for children, 15-24 for youth, 
		25-64 for adults, and 65+ for seniors. Beyond this, I decided to ignore all distinguishment between males and females. My first sketch attempted to begin addressing this question with a stacked bar chart. This 
		sketch was effective at demonstrating how the total population was significantly greater in 2000 than 1900. Additionally, it effectively distinguished age groups with the use of distinct colors. However, it less 
		effectively communicated how each specific age group changed over time, apart from that they all simply increased with the total population. This motivated my second sketch, the stacked area chart. In this chart, I was 
		able to include age-group labels directly in the visualization, which is clearer than a legend. This sketch communicated the average continuous trend for each age group between 1900 and 2000 much more effectively 
		than the first sketch, thus it is a strictly better visualization. However, since each age-group's population increased significantly during this century, it does not effectively communicate the difference in relative proportions of the total population 
		of each age group between the two years. This motivated my third sketch: the dual pie chart. This effectively showed the relative proportions of the total population of each age group in both 1900 and 2000. However, 
		it again did not effectively show average trends throughout the century. For the next phase, I aim to combine the strengths of the second and third sketches to produce a visualization that effectively communicates the
		change in relative proportions of each age group, while demonstrating it as a trend thoughout time and including distinct colors and labels for clear understanding.

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

			<p>
				Per the title, I refined my question to: How has the age distribution of the U.S. population changed from 1900 to 2000? To create this visualization, I needed to create a new Group for the Age data. Additionally, I needed
				to create a new Calculated Field for Total Population per Year, as well as a Calculated Field for Percentage of Age Group. Then, I created an area chart of Percentage of Age Group vs. Year and overlaid it with a stacked
				bar chart of Percentage of Age Group vs. Year. I decided to include this overlaid bar chart because it clearly shows that the data is explicitly from the years 1900 and 2000, and not the years between. I decided to include
				the area chart in between the stacked bar chart because it makes it much easier for the viewer to see, and therefore understand, how the relative proportions of each age-group changed, which is the intended message of the
				visualization. I decided to include labels on the bar chart displaying the true values of the proportions, again to make it easier for the viewer to understand. Additionally, I labeled each age-group with a distinct color
				and corresponding label. Interestingly, I decided to use shades of blue to define a nominal ordering of the age groups - darker blue corresponds to older age-group. In line with this, I had the positions of the age-groups
				 in the "stack" correspond to this order. I think this is more aesthetically-pleasing as well.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
        Nearly every design decision in my final visualization was directly borrowed, or inspired, from one or more of my initial sketches. As a result, my sketches heavily informed my final design. I combined the general structures of 
		sketch one and two, and used the data transformation of sketch three to redefine my axes, for my final visualization. In reflection, the sketching process was very useful and undoubtedly resulted in a better designed, easier to understand,
		and more informative visualization. In the future, I will keep this workflow in my toolbox to design better visualizations.
