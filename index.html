			<h2>Phase One: Sketching Visualizations</h2>
			<p>
				Initial Question: How did the population of age groups change from 1900 to 2000?
			</p>

      <figure>
				<img src="bar.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Children: 0-14 years old, Youth: 14-24 years old, Adults: 25-64 years old, Seniors: 65+ years old
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The motivation behind a stacked bar chart was to facilitate a direct and immediate comparison between the two years. By stacking the age groups, the chart would quickly show the differences in age distribution.</li>
				<li>Different colors for each age group were chosen to create a clear visual distinction, allowing viewers to quickly identify and compare specific age groups.</li>
				<li>The legend was included because some individual sections of the bars were not large enough to fit an age-group label, and it would have been repetitive to include the same labels twice.</li>
				<li>What works well is the simplicity of comparison for the two different years. What doesn't work as effectively is showing the trend over the years between the two points, which I aim to address in the next sketch.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="area.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Children: 0-14 years old, Youth: 14-24 years old, Adults: 25-64 years old, Seniors: 65+ years old
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The area chart was chosen to illustrate the continuous evolution of the population's age profile over the entire century.</li>
				<li>Stacked areas were used to represent the growth or decline of each demographic segment, showing how each age group's population has changed over time.</li>
				<li>The age-group labels could easily be included in the stacked areas, which is a nicer design than including a legend, especially since only one label was needed per age-group.</li>
				<li>The reported population is significantly higher in 2000 than 1900. Therefore, while this effectively demonstrates the change in population of each age group, it doesn't effectively show the relative change in proportion amongst the age groups, which I aim to address in the next sketch.</li>
			</ul>

      <figure>
				<img src="pie.jpg" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Children: 0-14 years old, Youth: 14-24 years old, Adults: 25-64 years old, Seniors: 65+ years old
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The pie chart was chosen to emphasize the part-to-whole relationship within each year.</li>
				<li>Labeling each segment with percentages was intended to facilitate understanding of the exact proportion of each age group.</li>
				<li>Similar to the last sketch, it was possible to include one label per age-group in the visualization, so no legend was necessary.</li>
				<li>The strength of this approach is in showing the composition of the population. However, like the first visualization, it is not effective at showing the trend between the two years.</li>
			</ul>
